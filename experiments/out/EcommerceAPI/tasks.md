# Lab Tasks

1. Implement the `GetProducts` and `GetUsers` functions in the handlers to fetch data from the database.
2. Add validation for the `Product` and `User` models to ensure required fields are present.
3. Write unit tests for the `CreateProduct` and `CreateUser` functions to ensure they handle valid and invalid input correctly.
