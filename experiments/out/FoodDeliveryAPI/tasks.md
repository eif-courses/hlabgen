# Lab Tasks

1. **Implement secure authentication with JWT**: Create a middleware that checks for a valid JWT token in the request headers before allowing access to certain routes.

2. **Add transactional order processing or workflow logic**: Implement a service that handles the order processing, ensuring that the order is created only if the menu item is available and the user has sufficient balance.

3. **Implement complex search with filters and relations**: Create an endpoint that allows users to search for restaurants or menu items based on various filters such as cuisine type, price range, and ratings.
