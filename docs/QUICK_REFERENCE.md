# HLabGen Metrics System - Quick Reference Card

## Problem in 30 Seconds

Your experiment logs show 450 raw runs instead of 90 aggregated results.

**Looks like:** `AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 123.29s` repeated 5 times (appears broken)  
**Actually is:** 5 independent runs of same config with different durations  
**Solution:** Show `AuctionAPI | hybrid | 5 | 70.2±0.0% | 81.4±23.6s` (professional!)

## Your Experimental Setup

```
30 APIs × 3 modes × 5 runs = 450 total runs

breakdown:
├── 30 APIs: LibraryAPI, BlogAPI, AuctionAPI, ... (see detailed.csv)
├── 3 modes: rules, ml, hybrid
└── 5 runs: For variance estimation and reproducibility
```

---

## Current Results (Summary)

```
Mode    | Build% | Tests% | Coverage% | Duration(s) | Lint
--------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|------
rules   | 100.0  | 100.0  | 72.2      | 0.03        | 0
ml      | 89.3   | 0.0    | 0.0       | 90.0        | 12
hybrid  | 92.0   | 91.3   | 64.4      | 77.0        | 3.8
```

**Interpretation**: Hybrid is best (91.3% tests pass vs 0% for ML)

## What Each Metric Means

| Metric | Good Value | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Build% | ≥90 | Compilation success rate |
| Tests% | ≥90 | Unit test pass rate |
| Coverage% | ≥70 | Code coverage percentage |
| Duration(s) | <100 | Generation time in seconds |

## Code Template (Copy-Paste Ready)

```go
// Add to main.go

// Step 1: Define struct
type AggregatedRun struct {
    App              string
    Mode             string
    RunCount         int
    BuildSuccessRate float64
    TestsPassRate    float64
    AvgCoverage      float64
    StdDevCoverage   float64

    AvgVetWarnings   float64
    AvgCyclomatic    float64
    AvgFixes         float64
}

// Step 2: Add to main()
allRuns := []Run{}
for _, runs := range data {
    allRuns = append(allRuns, runs...)
}

aggregated := aggregateByAppMode(allRuns)
generateAggregatedResultsMarkdown(aggregated, *reportDir)
generateAggregatedCSV(aggregated, *reportDir)

// Step 3: Add functions (see IMPLEMENTATION guide for full code)
func aggregateByAppMode(allRuns []Run) []AggregatedRun { /* ... */ }
func meanStdDev(values []float64) (float64, float64) { /* ... */ }
func generateAggregatedResultsMarkdown(agg []AggregatedRun, dir string) { /* ... */ }
func generateAggregatedCSV(agg []AggregatedRun, dir string) { /* ... */ }
```

## Testing

```bash
# Build
cd cmd/gather-metrics && go build -o gather-metrics .

# Run
./gather-metrics -out experiments/out -report experiments/reports

# Verify new files
ls -la experiments/reports/results_aggregated.*

# View results
head -20 experiments/reports/results_aggregated.md
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Aggregated Markdown: experiments/reports/results_aggregated.md
✅ Aggregated CSV: experiments/reports/results_aggregated.csv
```

## Data Structure

### Before (Raw - 450 rows)
```
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 123.29s
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 63.74s   ← Duplicate?
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 79.93s   ← Duplicate?
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 65.20s   ← Duplicate?
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 70.2% | 74.81s   ← Duplicate?
```

### After (Aggregated - 90 rows)
```
AuctionAPI | hybrid | 5 | 70.2±0.0% | 81.4±23.6s ← All 5 summarized!
```

---

## Standard Deviation Interpretation

```
Duration: 81.4 ± 23.6 seconds

means:
- Average generation time: 81.4 seconds
- Variability: ±23.6 seconds (95% confidence)
- Range: Typically 57.8s to 105.0s

Why variable?
- GPT API response time varies
- Network latency inconsistent
- Model temperature/randomness

Rule of thumb:
- Small std dev (±1) → Consistent
- Large std dev (±25) → Highly variable
```

## Common Questions

**Q: How many runs per config?**  
A: 5 runs (for variance estimation)

**Q: Why show variance?**  
A: Scientific rigor - shows GPT is inherently non-deterministic

**Q: Which file for papers?**  
A: `results_aggregated.md` (90 rows, professional)

**Q: Should I keep raw data?**  
A: YES! Keep `detailed.csv` for reproducibility

**Q: How long to implement?**  
A: ~45 minutes coding + testing

**Q: Will it break existing scripts?**  
A: No, only adds new files

## Success Indicators

After implementation, you'll have:

✅ `results_aggregated.md` with 90 rows  
✅ Each row shows mean ± std dev  
✅ Looks professional and publication-ready  
✅ All raw data preserved in `detailed.csv`  
✅ `make report` generates both old + new files

## Publication Template

For your paper:

> **Table 1. Aggregated Experimental Results**

> | API | Mode | Build% | Tests% | Coverage% | Duration(s) |
> |-----|------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
